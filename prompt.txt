These are the APIs defined.

Robot APIs:
        
    Name: place_object
    Signature: place_object(x: float, y: float, object: str) -> bool
    Input: x, y coordinates of object to place, and the name of the object being placed
    Output: True if object is placed, False otherwise
    
    Name: pick_object
    Signature: pick_object(x: float, y: float, object: str) -> bool
    Input: x, y coordinates of object to pick, and name of the object being picked
    Output: True if object is picked, False otherwise
    
    Name: move_to
    Signature: move_to(location: str) -> bool
    Input: location to move to
    Output: True if robot moves to location, False otherwise
    
Utils APIs:
        
    Name: detect_objects
    Description: Returns the coordinates of the objects queried by the input parameter objects
    Signature: detect_objects(objects: list) -> dict
    Input: None the coordinates of the objects queried by the input parameter objects
    Signature: detect_objects(objects: list) -> dict
    Input: None
    Output dictionary of the format
    {
        'object': 'object_name',
        'location': {"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0}
    }
    
    Name: say
